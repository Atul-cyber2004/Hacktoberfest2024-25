/*
Program to Check Whether a Number is a Power of 2.

Description:
Given an integer, determine whether it is a power of two.
A number is a power of two if it can be expressed as 2^n,
where n is a non-negative integer.

Example:
Input: 8
Output: 8 is a power of 2.

Explanation:
8 can be represented as 2^3, so it is a power of 2.

    /*
        Logic:
        - In binary, a power of two has exactly one bit set.
        - Example:
            1  -> 0001
            2  -> 0010
            4  -> 0100
            8  -> 1000
        - The expression (n & (n - 1)) clears the lowest set bit.
        - So, if (n & (n - 1)) == 0 and n > 0 â†’ it's a power of 2.

    if (n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0)
        printf("%d is a power of 2.\n", n);
    else
        printf("%d is not a power of 2.\n", n);

    return 0;
